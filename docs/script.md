Software Engineers spend their entire careers held back by a common limitation.

A handicap so universal that almost no one realizes just how crippled they are.

Programmers. are. blind.

We cannot actually see the internal workings of these programs we create.

We're forced to rely on our imaginations 

to understand the hidden movements of our applications and as a consequence, 

those increadibly complicated internal mechanisms 

remain mostly invisible, even to their creators.

We're about to change that, and give Engineers eyes to see their invisible machines.

I'm Luke Davis. This is Ryan Lee, Andy Coenen, and Matt Conrad.

And this, is Holograf.
